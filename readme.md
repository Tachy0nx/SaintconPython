# Introduction
The purpose of this training is to go from 0-60 with Python within a day.  We have about 7 hours to cover a lot of material.  Your typical conference information through a fire hose reminiscent of any hollywood movie depicting chow time during boot camp.

Although not  not strictly tied to the the morning and afternoon session we will cover the following:

* Morning Session - Python Basics
  
    * Getting started
    * Data types and Control structures 
    * Functions and decorators
    * Useful Python functions 
* Afternoon Session - Getting Productive

    * Working with command line arguments 
    * Working with data - files: txt, JSON, and office
    * Working with the internet
    * More

This is a lofty goal so there are some sacrifice that need to be made.  We won't have time to talk about the fundamentals of computer science or algorithm design - but if there is need for that let us know!

Completion of the material in this course will provide you with a basic foundation in Python programming and a collection of recipes to help you start completing your own productive projects in python.   

**This is a hands on training and you will spend much of the time writing Python code.**

Please be sure to check out the [Prerequisites](Module&#32;00&#32;-&#32;Front&#32;Matter/readme.md) prior to the session.
